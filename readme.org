* GEN_PYTHON_REQ
This repository contains a script capable of generating the 'requirements.txt' file based solely on the imports made in the .py files.

** Execution
This script can be run as follows:
#+begin_src sh
$ python3 gen_req.py /path/to/your/project
# OR
$ python3 gen_req.py /path/to/your/project --venv_folder your_venv_folder_name
#+end_src

Use =python3 gen_req.py -h= to see the help message.

** Note about pipreqs
Indeed, there are other packages aimed at generating 'requirements.txt' files, such as [[https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs][pipreqs]]. However, for some reason, it did not work correctly for me :')
